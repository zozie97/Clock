### Roman Clock

My final idea is based off of Roman times and how they viewed the world. They viewed the world as flat and so i have made the sun, moon and mars move across the screen in a straight line instead of in an arc or rotating around the earth. The sun represents the hours, the planet mars represents the minutes and the moon represents the seconds. Earth is stationary as the romans believed that the universe revolved around the Earth not the sun as we now know. 

The background colour changes depending on what time of the day it is, it goes from black then to a dark blue then  blue then during the middle of the day a light blue, then transitions the same way back to black.

The stars in the background are mainly there as a design aspect, but there are a few constellations as well as the ancient romans saw pictures in the stars which they then based their mythology with. There are two specific constellations in my clock, the southern cross to the left and the constellation Cancer to the right of earth.

This final idea is very different to my first idea and sketch which i did, a modern digital clock which combined aspects of original analogue clocks. But the theme of using original time keeping aspects is somewhat similar. I then decided to create a clock based on a sundial and from that i migrated to the roman clock idea.

Overall i am happy with the final outcome of my clock, as i am interested in ancient roman times and how they percieved life so differntly to how we do now.

I have made branches to update my files but since doing this my thumbnails have not been working, it has come up with an error saying that my thumbnails are untracked and so wont commit. # Clock
